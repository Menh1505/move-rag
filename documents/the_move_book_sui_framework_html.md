# The Move Book

Sui Framework is a default dependency set in the  [Package Manifest](./../concepts/manifest.html) . It
depends on the  [Standard Library](./../move-basics/standard-library.html)  and provides Sui-specific
features, including the interaction with the storage, and Sui-specific native types and modules.

For convenience, we grouped the modules in the Sui Framework into multiple categories. But they're
still part of the same framework.

Sui Framework exports two named addresses:  sui = 0x2  and  std = 0x1  from the std dependency.

Just like with  [Standard Library](./../move-basics/standard-library.html#implicit-imports) , some of
the modules and types are imported implicitly in the Sui Framework. This is the list of modules and
types that are available without explicit  use  import:

The source code of the Sui Framework is available in the
 [Sui repository](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/tree/main/crates/sui-framework/packages/sui-framework/sources) .
