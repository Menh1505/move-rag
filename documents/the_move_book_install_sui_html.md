# The Move Book

Move is a compiled language, so you need to install a compiler to be able to write and run Move
programs. The compiler is included into the Sui binary, which can be installed or downloaded using
one of the methods below.

You can download the latest Sui binary from the
 [releases page](https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui/releases) . The binary is available for macOS,

You can install Sui using the  [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)  package manager.

You can install Sui using the  [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install)  package manager for
Windows.

You can install and build Sui locally by using the Cargo package manager (requires Rust)

Change the branch target here to  testnet  or  devnet  if you are targeting one of those.

Make sure that your system has the latest Rust versions with the command below.
