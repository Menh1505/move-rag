# The Move Book

Control flow statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program. They are used to
make decisions, repeat a block of code, or exit a block of code early. Move includes the following
control flow statements (explained in detail below):

The  if  expression is used to make decisions in a program. It evaluates a
 [boolean expression](./expression.html#literals)  and executes a block of code if the expression is
true. Paired with  else , it can execute a different block of code if the expression is false.

The syntax for an  if  expression is:

Just like any other expression,  if  requires a semicolon if there are other expressions following
it. The  else  keyword is optional, except when the resulting value is assigned to a variable, as all 
branches must return a value to ensure type safety. Let’s examine how an  if  expression works in Move
with the following example:

Let's see how we can use  if  and  else  to assign a value to a variable:

In this example, the value of the  if  expression is assigned to the variable  y . If  x  is greater than 0,  y  is assigned the value 1; otherwise, it is assigned 0. The  else  block is required because both branches of the  if  expression must return a value of the same type. Omitting the  else  block would result in a compiler error, as it ensures all possible branches are accounted for and type safety is maintained.

Conditional expressions are among the most important control flow statements in Move. They evaluate user-provided input or stored data to make decisions. One key use case is in the  [assert!](./assert-and-abort.html)  macro , which checks if a condition is true and aborts execution if it is not. We’ll explore this in detail shortly.

Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. Move has two built-in types of loops:
 loop  and  while . In many cases they can be used interchangeably, but usually  while  is used when
the number of iterations is known in advance, and  loop  is used when the number of iterations is
not known in advance or there are multiple exit points.

Loops are useful for working with collections, such as vectors, or for repeating a block of code until a specific condition is met. However, take care to avoid infinite loops, which can exhaust gas limits and cause the transaction to abort.

The  while  statement executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a boolean expression evaluates to true.
Just like we've seen with  if , the boolean expression is evaluated before each iteration of the
loop. Additionally, like conditional statements, the  while  loop is an expression and requires a semicolon
if there are other expressions following it.

The syntax for the  while  loop is:

Here is an example of a  while  loop with a very simple condition:

Now let's imagine a scenario where the boolean expression is always  true . For example, if we
literally passed  true  to the  while  condition. This is similar to how the  loop  statement functions, 
except that  while  evaluates a condition.

An infinite  while  loop, or a  while  loop with an always  true  condition, is equivalent to a  loop . The syntax for creating a  loop  is straightforward:

Let's rewrite the previous example using  loop  instead of  while :

Infinite loops are rarely practical in Move, as every operation consumes gas, and an infinite loop will inevitably lead to gas exhaustion. If you find yourself using a loop, consider whether there might be a better approach, as many use cases can be handled more efficiently with other control flow structures. That said,  loop  might be useful when combined with  break  and  continue  statements to create controlled and flexible looping behavior.

As we already mentioned, infinite loops are rather useless on their own. And that's where we
introduce the  break  and  continue  statements. They are used to exit a loop early, and to skip the
rest of the current iteration, respectively.

Syntax for the  break  statement is (without a semicolon):

The  break  statement is used to stop the execution of a loop and exit it early. It is often used in
combination with a conditional statement to exit the loop when a certain condition is met. To
illustrate this point, let's turn the infinite  loop  from the previous example into something that
looks and behaves more like a  while  loop:

Almost identical to the  while  loop, right? The  break  statement is used to exit the loop when  x 
is 5. If we remove the  break  statement, the loop will run forever, just like in the previous example.

The  continue  statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and start the next one.
Similarly to  break , it is used in combination with a conditional statement to skip the rest of an
iteration when a certain condition is met.

Syntax for the  continue  statement is (without a semicolon):

The example below skips odd numbers and prints only even numbers from 0 to 10:

break  and  continue  statements can be used in both  while  and  loop  loops.

The  return  statement is used to exit a  [function](./function.html)  early and return a value. It is
often used in combination with a conditional statement to exit the function when a certain condition
is met. The syntax for the  return  statement is:

Here is an example of a function that returns a value when a certain condition is met:

Unlike in many other languages, the  return  statement is not required for the last expression in a
function. The last expression in a function block is automatically returned. However, the  return 
statement is useful when we want to exit a function early if a certain condition is met.

## Conditional Statements

The  if  expression is used to make decisions in a program. It evaluates a
 [boolean expression](./expression.html#literals)  and executes a block of code if the expression is
true. Paired with  else , it can execute a different block of code if the expression is false.

The syntax for an  if  expression is:

```bash
if (<bool_expression>) <expression>;
if (<bool_expression>) <expression> else <expression>;
```

Just like any other expression,  if  requires a semicolon if there are other expressions following
it. The  else  keyword is optional, except when the resulting value is assigned to a variable, as all 
branches must return a value to ensure type safety. Let’s examine how an  if  expression works in Move
with the following example:

```bash
#[test]
fun test_if() {
    let x = 5;

    // `x > 0` is a boolean expression.
    if (x > 0) {
        std::debug::print(&b"X is bigger than 0".to_string())
    };
}
```

Let's see how we can use  if  and  else  to assign a value to a variable:

```bash
#[test]
fun test_if_else() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = if (x > 0) {
        1
    } else {
        0
    };

    assert!(y == 1);
}
```

In this example, the value of the  if  expression is assigned to the variable  y . If  x  is greater than 0,  y  is assigned the value 1; otherwise, it is assigned 0. The  else  block is required because both branches of the  if  expression must return a value of the same type. Omitting the  else  block would result in a compiler error, as it ensures all possible branches are accounted for and type safety is maintained.

Conditional expressions are among the most important control flow statements in Move. They evaluate user-provided input or stored data to make decisions. One key use case is in the  [assert!](./assert-and-abort.html)  macro , which checks if a condition is true and aborts execution if it is not. We’ll explore this in detail shortly.

loop. Additionally, like conditional statements, the  while  loop is an expression and requires a semicolon
if there are other expressions following it.

The syntax for the  while  loop is:

```bash
while (<bool_expression>) { <expressions>; };
```

Here is an example of a  while  loop with a very simple condition:

```bash
// This function iterates over the `x` variable until it reaches 10, the
// return value is the number of iterations it took to reach 10.
//
// If `x` is 0, then the function will return 10.
// If `x` is 5, then the function will return 5.
fun while_loop(mut x: u8): u8 {
    let mut y = 0;

    // This will loop until `x` is 10.
    // And will never run if `x` is 10 or more.
    while (x < 10) {
        y = y + 1;
        x = x + 1;
    };

    y
}

#[test]
fun test_while() {
    assert!(while_loop(0) == 10); // 10 times
    assert!(while_loop(5) == 5);  // 5 times
    assert!(while_loop(10) == 0); // loop never executed
}
```

Now let's imagine a scenario where the boolean expression is always  true . For example, if we
literally passed  true  to the  while  condition. This is similar to how the  loop  statement functions, 
except that  while  evaluates a condition.

```bash
#[test, expected_failure(out_of_gas, location=Self)]
fun test_infinite_while() {
    let mut x = 0;

    // This will loop forever.
    while (true) {
        x = x + 1;
    };

    // This line will never be executed.
    assert!(x == 5);
}
```

An infinite  while  loop, or a  while  loop with an always  true  condition, is equivalent to a  loop . The syntax for creating a  loop  is straightforward:

```bash
loop { <expressions>; };
```

Let's rewrite the previous example using  loop  instead of  while :

```bash
#[test, expected_failure(out_of_gas, location=Self)]
fun test_infinite_loop() {
    let mut x = 0;

    // This will loop forever.
    loop {
        x = x + 1;
    };

    // This line will never be executed.
    assert!(x == 5);
}
```

        x = x + 1;

        // If `x` is 5, then exit the loop.
        if (x == 5) {
            break // Exit the loop.
        }
    };

    assert!(x == 5);
}
```

Almost identical to the  while  loop, right? The  break  statement is used to exit the loop when  x 
is 5. If we remove the  break  statement, the loop will run forever, just like in the previous example.

continue
```

The example below skips odd numbers and prints only even numbers from 0 to 10:

```bash
#[test]
fun test_continue_loop() {
    let mut x = 0;

    // This will loop until `x` is 10.
    loop {
        x = x + 1;

        // If `x` is odd, then skip the rest of the iteration.
        if (x % 2 == 1) {
            continue // Skip the rest of the iteration.
        };

        std::debug::print(&x);

        // If `x` is 10, then exit the loop.
        if (x == 10) {
            break // Exit the loop.
        }
    };

    assert!(x == 10); // 10
}
```

break  and  continue  statements can be used in both  while  and  loop  loops.

The  return  statement is used to exit a  [function](./function.html)  early and return a value. It is
often used in combination with a conditional statement to exit the function when a certain condition
is met. The syntax for the  return  statement is:

```bash
return <expression>
```

Here is an example of a function that returns a value when a certain condition is met:

```bash
/// This function returns `true` if `x` is greater than 0 and not 5,
/// otherwise it returns `false`.
fun is_positive(x: u8): bool {
    if (x == 5) {
        return false
    };

    if (x > 0) {
        return true
    };

    false
}

#[test]
fun test_return() {
    assert!(is_positive(5) == false);
    assert!(is_positive(0) == false);
    assert!(is_positive(1) == true);
}
```

Unlike in many other languages, the  return  statement is not required for the last expression in a
function. The last expression in a function block is automatically returned. However, the  return 
statement is useful when we want to exit a function early if a certain condition is met.

## Repeating Statements with Loops

// If `x` is 5, then the function will return 5.
fun while_loop(mut x: u8): u8 {
    let mut y = 0;

    // This will loop until `x` is 10.
    // And will never run if `x` is 10 or more.
    while (x < 10) {
        y = y + 1;
        x = x + 1;
    };

    y
}

#[test]
fun test_while() {
    assert!(while_loop(0) == 10); // 10 times
    assert!(while_loop(5) == 5);  // 5 times
    assert!(while_loop(10) == 0); // loop never executed

    assert!(is_positive(1) == true);
}
```

Unlike in many other languages, the  return  statement is not required for the last expression in a
function. The last expression in a function block is automatically returned. However, the  return 
statement is useful when we want to exit a function early if a certain condition is met.

## Infinite 

Now let's imagine a scenario where the boolean expression is always  true . For example, if we
literally passed  true  to the  while  condition. This is similar to how the  loop  statement functions, 
except that  while  evaluates a condition.

```bash
#[test, expected_failure(out_of_gas, location=Self)]
fun test_infinite_while() {
    let mut x = 0;

    // This will loop forever.
    while (true) {
        x = x + 1;
    };

    // This line will never be executed.
    assert!(x == 5);
}
```

An infinite  while  loop, or a  while  loop with an always  true  condition, is equivalent to a  loop . The syntax for creating a  loop  is straightforward:

```bash
loop { <expressions>; };
```

Let's rewrite the previous example using  loop  instead of  while :

```bash
#[test, expected_failure(out_of_gas, location=Self)]
fun test_infinite_loop() {
    let mut x = 0;

    // This will loop forever.
    loop {
        x = x + 1;
    };

    // This line will never be executed.
    assert!(x == 5);
}
```

Infinite loops are rarely practical in Move, as every operation consumes gas, and an infinite loop will inevitably lead to gas exhaustion. If you find yourself using a loop, consider whether there might be a better approach, as many use cases can be handled more efficiently with other control flow structures. That said,  loop  might be useful when combined with  break  and  continue  statements to create controlled and flexible looping behavior.

As we already mentioned, infinite loops are rather useless on their own. And that's where we
introduce the  break  and  continue  statements. They are used to exit a loop early, and to skip the
rest of the current iteration, respectively.

Syntax for the  break  statement is (without a semicolon):

```bash
break
```

The  break  statement is used to stop the execution of a loop and exit it early. It is often used in
combination with a conditional statement to exit the loop when a certain condition is met. To
illustrate this point, let's turn the infinite  loop  from the previous example into something that
looks and behaves more like a  while  loop:

```bash
#[test]
fun test_break_loop() {
    let mut x = 0;

    // This will loop until `x` is 5.
    loop {
        x = x + 1;

        // If `x` is 5, then exit the loop.
        if (x == 5) {
            break // Exit the loop.
        }
    };

    assert!(x == 5);
}
```

Almost identical to the  while  loop, right? The  break  statement is used to exit the loop when  x 
is 5. If we remove the  break  statement, the loop will run forever, just like in the previous example.

The  continue  statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and start the next one.
Similarly to  break , it is used in combination with a conditional statement to skip the rest of an
iteration when a certain condition is met.

Syntax for the  continue  statement is (without a semicolon):

```bash
continue
```

The example below skips odd numbers and prints only even numbers from 0 to 10:

```bash
#[test]
fun test_continue_loop() {
    let mut x = 0;

    // This will loop until `x` is 10.
    loop {
        x = x + 1;

        // If `x` is odd, then skip the rest of the iteration.
        if (x % 2 == 1) {
            continue // Skip the rest of the iteration.
        };

        std::debug::print(&x);

        // If `x` is 10, then exit the loop.
        if (x == 10) {
            break // Exit the loop.
        }
    };

    assert!(x == 10); // 10
}
```

break  and  continue  statements can be used in both  while  and  loop  loops.

The  return  statement is used to exit a  [function](./function.html)  early and return a value. It is
often used in combination with a conditional statement to exit the function when a certain condition
is met. The syntax for the  return  statement is:

```bash
return <expression>
```

Here is an example of a function that returns a value when a certain condition is met:

```bash
/// This function returns `true` if `x` is greater than 0 and not 5,
/// otherwise it returns `false`.
fun is_positive(x: u8): bool {
    if (x == 5) {
        return false
    };

    if (x > 0) {
        return true
    };

    false
}

#[test]
fun test_return() {
    assert!(is_positive(5) == false);
    assert!(is_positive(0) == false);
    assert!(is_positive(1) == true);
}
```

Unlike in many other languages, the  return  statement is not required for the last expression in a
function. The last expression in a function block is automatically returned. However, the  return 
statement is useful when we want to exit a function early if a certain condition is met.

        }
    };

        if (x % 2 == 1) {
            continue // Skip the rest of the iteration.
        };

        std::debug::print(&x);

        // If `x` is 10, then exit the loop.
        if (x == 10) {
            break // Exit the loop.

    false
}
